Welcome to my Rootkit project. 

it's not done yet, so it will be updated in the feature. 
for now I support - 
* hidding from lsmod
* hiding files from ls
* hiding sockets from netstat
* root privileges escalation
* a basic keylogger (not finished)


all is compiled and tested for *Kernel 4.15* in *Ubuntu 16.04* 

*Please don't use for not legit proposals*
